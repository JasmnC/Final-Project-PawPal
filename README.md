## About The Project
### Probelm Statement
According to research by the Society for Human Resource Management, between 22% and 35% of U.S. employees are experiencing symptoms of depression as they live through the COVID-19 pandemic.

Meanwhile, the street animal has always been an issue for the environment. The overall US adoption rate was between 37% and 41%.

More than 23 million American households, which is 1 out of 5, has adopted an animal during covid. This number was a 250% increase compared to 2019 before covid.

### Proposed Solution

We combine these two social issues together and provide a system that makes the process of adopting street animals easy and secure. 

We consider the use case from rescuers, medical checkers, volunteers, and adopters. At the same time, with the use case of system administrator, this system is expandable at the global level. 

The purpose of our system is to make sure the animal is healthy both mentally and physically; at the same time, we verify the adopter is qualified before accessing the animalâ€™s information. We also provide the opportunity to volunteer and the volunteers could process their work independently.

## Usage
### Stackholders: 
 - System Admin
 - Animal Shelter
